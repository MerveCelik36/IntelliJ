What is method overriding in java:
    When same method with same header exists in the child class as well we call it method
    overriding.
Why we should override a method:
    if we inherit from a class all the methods which are not private they are inherited in
    the child class now if we don't like some of these methods may because they consume more
    internet bandwidth or consume a lof of CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them in
    the child class.
How can we use method Overriding.
    1)we must first inherit from a class.
    2) we can redeclare the method with same header and provide the body of our choice.
Example:

class Parent{

void eat(){
System.out.println(" I like to eat Beef");
}
void sleep(){
System.out.println(" I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
}
}
class Child extends Parent{

void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Mutton");
}

}
Rule:
    1) we must have a super class derived class relationship
    2) Method in the parent and child class must have same headers but they can be
    different in terms of access modifiers and in very rear conditions in terms of return
    type.
    3) we can't change the access modifier from public to protected or default but we can
    do it in reverse order.
    4) we can't override constructors because they are also not inherited.
    5) If a method is static we use a different terminology it's called method redeclaration
    instead of overriding.
