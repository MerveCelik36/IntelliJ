Maps in java:
    Map is an interface in java that allows us to store key value pairs. Keys can't be duplicate but values can be.
There many types of maps, but we will only discuss 3 of them and will also touch a 4th one.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashmap 3) TreeMap 4) HashTable(slow and old because of thread safety)
HashMap:
    Upside: It's the fastest of all.
    Downside: Does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: order is maintain.
    Downside: retrieval speed is slow. insertion speed is better than TreeMap But slower than HashMap.
TreeMap:
    Upside: Data is always stored in the sorted form.
    Downside: insertion speed is slowest of all. Retrieval speed is slower than Hashmap but faster than LinkedHashmap.
HashTable:
    its old and slow but provides thread safety.
Important Note:
We can use three methods to get the data from a map
        1) EntrySet(): key,value store inside an object of type Map.Entry. we can use getKey() method on this object
    to get the key of that entry and getValue() method to get the value of that entry.
    2) KeySet(): it will return all the keys from a map in the form of a set.
    3) values(): it will return us all the values from a map in the form of a collection.

FileHandling in java:
    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of the file that we want to read/write
    2) we need to navigate to that file.
    3) we need to have a software installed on our computers to interact with that file.

    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of a file we can store inside a String
    2) we can use the FIleInputStream/FileOutputStream class to navigate to that folder.
    3) we use a specific java class that can handle that file type
