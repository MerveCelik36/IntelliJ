What is method:
is block of code , a group of java statements.. it defines the behavior of a class.
Why we use it:
it help us to remove duplicate code from our application. we just create a method
and every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
it also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development
of large applications easier.
How to use methods:
1. we create a method inside a class
2. we create the object of the class
3. we call the methods by writing the name of the object a dot name of a method.
example: class Calculator{
Rules to create and use methods:
void add(int x, int y){
System.out.println(x+y) // we will need main method to able to execute it.
public static void main(String[]args){

Calculator calculator= new Calculator(
calculator.add(10,20); //30
void ==> void is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data write
the same of that data type like for int we write int for String
we write String and if we don't want to return anything we write void
when we write a void we can't assign a method call toa variable.

add==> we write the name of the method which can be anything it should follow the
rules for giving a name to a name to a variable.

()==> we specify the parameters here we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis.
They are optional. we can leave them empty.

add(int x, int y)==> this part with the name of the method and its parameters is called
signature of a method.
void add(int x,int y)==>header of the methods.

Body of the method:
{
System.out.println();

}
the body of teh method that contains the java statement
=======================================================================
type of Variables in Java:
there are three type variables in java.
1. Local variable:
 if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameters or a loop
oor switch statement it is called a local variable.They are accessible only in the {}
2. Instance variable:
 if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.
3. Static Variables:
 if an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called static variable.
 String name; // instance variable
     static int num5; // static

     void printName(){
         String name="Local"; // Local variable
         System.out.println(name);
         WHY LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF VARIABLES?
     1.IT HELPS US REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF "RAM"THAT OUR APPLICATIONS WILL BE USING WHEN IT WILL BE RUNNING.
     2. WITH THE HELP OF THESE VARIABLES WE CAN PASS THE INFORMATION BETWEEN METHODS OF CLASS.
     3.LOCAL VARIABLES OCCUPY THE MEMORY OR THE SHORTEST PERIOD OF TIME AS SOON AS YOUR METHOD
     IS DONE EXECUTING THEY ARE DESTROYED BY A SPECIAL PROGRAM CALLED GARBAGE COLLECTOR.

How to use these:
    Local: create inside block of code

Advantages vs disadvantages

Local variables:
Advantages:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. Always try to use local
    variables when possible to save memory.
Disadvantages:
    They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or that block
    of code.

Instance variables:
Advantages:
    They have broader scope as compared to local variables, means we can access in all the methods
    of that class.
Disadvantages:
    They occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time.

static Variables:
Advantages:
    We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
    We can share a single variable between all the objects of a class
