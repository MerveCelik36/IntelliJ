Set :
    Set in java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets but we
    will only discuss the most widely used ones which are
    1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashset 3) TreeSet
HashSet:
    Upside: Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to insert and
    retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
    No get method to get a single value.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrieval speed is the
    slowest.
TreeSet:
    Upside: The Data is stored in the sorted form.
    Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than linkedHashSet
    but slower than Hashset.
Note:
Mostly used to remove duplicates.
=============================================================
Map:
    Allow to store key value pairs. first Entry is treated as key and the second one is
    treated as value. Keys can't be duplicate but values can be.
    Map<Integer,String> items=new HashMap<>();
    There are many types of Maps as sets but we will only discuss 3 of them.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: insertion speed slower than HashMap Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
TreeMap:
    Upside: data is stored in sorted form always.
    Downside: insertion speed is very slow.
Choose proper DataStructure.
    Q1:I want to store unique names in the sorted form.
    A: TreeSet
    Q2: I want to store the names of the students and most of the time i will be
    performing operation related to data retrieval based on index.
    ArrayList
