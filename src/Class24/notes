What is PolyMorphism:
    PolyMorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the
    object or parameters that we pass to a method.
    When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently then it is called.
    static PolyMorphism or compile time PolyMorphism or early binding.
    when we achieve the PolyMorphism through method overriding then it is called
    dynamic binding or run time PolyMorphism or late binding

why we should use Polymorphism:
    1. cleaner code
    2. we never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something
     we always want to create new method and new classes.we can call these methods
     using the parent classes variable/references.
    3. We can call multiple methods from many classes with the help of a single variable.
       Like we can create the array of objects and with help of a loop will be able
       call all the methods from all the classes.


How can we polymorphism:
    1.Create a parent child relationship
    2.override the method in the child classes.
    3.Create array of all the child class objects and with the hel[ of the loop you can call
      all the methods from all the child classes.

Rules:
    1. All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the polymorphism.
    2.We can store the object of the child class inside a variable of type parent class.
      But we cannot do the reverse.
    3.We can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold object of child class.
