There are three types of variables in java local instance static.
Local Variables:
    Are the variables which are created inside a block of code like method,
    loop switch statement if else condition or a constructor.

Advantages:
    We should always prefer local variables to instance or static variables because they
    live for the shortest period of time inside your RAM.
DisAdvantages:
    They can't be accessed outside the block of code in which they are created
Class Countries{

void USA(){

String person="Elisa Bro";
}

void Russia(){
System.out.println(person) // we will get an error because right now Person is only
//accessible in USA method
}

}
