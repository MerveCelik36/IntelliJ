What are Constructor:
    Constructor is a block of code that is used to construct objects.
Why we should use Constructor:
    Constructor help us initialize objects in cleaner and more readable way.
    They are better than methods because they are called automatically when we create an
    object.
    Most time fields are private and because of this reason we can't access them
    outside the class in which they are declared and can't initialize them.
How to use Constructor:
    We create the constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name.
    When we create the object of that class it is called automatically.
Rules:
    1) Constructor don't have return types not even void.
    2) Constructor should have same name as class name.
    3) Constructor can have access modifiers like private public and protected.
    4) Constructor can't have non access modifiers like static final synchronized.
    5) Default constructor is provided by java if we don't write one.
    6) When we create the object of a class then a Constructor is called. for example
    if the class name is Dog  Dog dog1=new Dog();
    7) We can create multiple Constructor to give the other users flexibility that they don't
    have to provide all the values to all the instance feilds when creating an object of our
    class.
    8) we can call the constructor of a class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
    this() we can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructor to
    call.
"this" keyword:
    When ever we can same name variables as instance variable and local variables this keyword can
    help us resolve the conflict between local and instance variable.
class Human{
String name="sleeping Zombi";

void printName(){
String name="wake up zombi"
System.out.println(this.name);
}

}

What is inheritance:
     Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods
     from the Parent class inside the child class.
Why we should use inheritance:
     Inheritance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write for example if there are some properties
     and methods which are present in many classes we can create a parent class for all of those
     properties and can put the common properties or method inside that parent class and can make children classes
     extend from that parent clas.
How we can use inheritance:
    1) Create a parent class
    2) put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class.
    3) use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class.

Types of inheritance:

Rules:
    1) private fields and private methods can't be inherited inside the children classes.
    2) Constructors are also not inherited.
