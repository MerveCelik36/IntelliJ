what is an interface:
    interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class are public
    static final(constants) and all the methods by default are also public.
Why we should learn about the interfaces:
    We can implement abstraction using interfaces.
    when class are logically connected to each other and we want to have instance fields and implemented
    methods as well while doing abstraction then we should go with abstract class.
How can i use an interface:
    we use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract methods

Rules:
    1)All the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
    2) No instance fields means no constructor is required.
    3) No instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract.
    4) when we implement the methods from the interface we use implements  keyword.
    5) Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in java.
    6) An interface can extend another interface.
    7) variables in interfaces can't be private protected or default.

What is Encapsulation in java:
   Encapsulation is 4th pillar of OOPs.it is a mechanism that provides us security. if we use encapsulation we can have more security.
How we should use Encapsulation:
    1) make your variables as private.
    2) Create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields.
==================================================================
Basic unit to store data is a variable:
It's easy to access the value by variable name we don't need to concern about indexes
problems with variables:
    1) They can only store one value at a time.
    2) if we have to store more than one value using variables we have to declare
    more variables.

Arrays:
    Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable we then use indexes to access
    those values.
Upside of Arrays:
    1)Arrays are the fastest data structure when it comes to process the data.
    2) Arrays occupy 4 times less memory than an arrayList.

problems with Arrays:
    1)They are fixed in size means once we have created an array we can't modify its size.
    2) No built-in methods in arrays like add remove findIndex etc.

ArrayList:
Note:
// ctl+c to select the complete line
//shift+end to select all the characters starting from your courser to teh end of line
soutv to print the last variable
iter to loop through the elements
reiter to loop in reverse order
