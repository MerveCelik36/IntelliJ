Exceptions in java:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviours that occur during the runtime(when java application is running).
    in Exception handling we write some kind of backup code to handle these runtime issues.
Why we should learn about exception handling:
    If we don't handle exceptions it can lead to bad user experience which in turn
    leads to low profits and bad reputation for the company.
How we handle exceptions:
    we handle exceptions using below code block and keywords.
    try catch block finally block try catch finally throw and throws.
Let's consider the below scenario.
    1) Read the data from an Excel file.
    2) execute a loop to go through all the rows in an Excel file from Sheet1
    3) Open Syntax HRM Login page in Google Chrome browser.
    4) Insert the data in the username and password field.
What are the things that can go wrong.
    Assumption i have tested this code very well on my computer and it works perfectly fine.
    No one has changed the code.
Issues in above scenario:
     1)java program tries to read the file but gets a file not found exception.
Possible causes:
    I)Someone has deleted or moved or renamed the file to a different location.
    II)File got corrupted because of a virus windows is not responding or there are not enough
    resources on my computer to read a file.
2) Someone like Oleg changed the sheet name in sameer's Excel file.
3) internet is down or website is not responding or Google Chrome is not installed or driver for
Google Chrome is not present anymore in the specified location
4 password of the application is changed and it is not updated in the Excel file etc.
