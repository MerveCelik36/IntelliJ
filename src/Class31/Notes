What FileHandling:
    Reading/writing data to a file is called file handling.
Why FileHandling is important:
    The data that changes frequently we don't put that data with
    code because if we have to change that data we need to recompile the
    code and redeploy the code on production servers again
    it's a very lengthy process and might take weeks. The other
    issue is we might accidentally change the code as well when
    changing the data and might introduce bugs.
